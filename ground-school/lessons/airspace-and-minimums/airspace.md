# Airspace

The portion of atmosphere above a country's territory and territorial waters divided into zones by authorities for managing air traffic, safety and military operations with international coordination by ICAO to ensure orderly flight.

## Types of Airspaces

### Controlled

Airspace where air traffic controllers (ATC) actively manage and provide services (i.e. separation) to aircraft.

Classes A, B, C, D and E are controlled airspaces.

### Uncontrolled

The part of airspace where ATC doesn't actively provide separation or direction to aircraft. Pilots here should rely on VFR and self-regulation such as using Common Traffic Advisory Frequencies (CTAFs).

Class G is uncontrolled airspace.

| Airspace Class | Memory Aid | Notes                                           |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A              | Altitude   | > 18,000 MSL ATC tracks                         |
| B              | Big        | big airports and aircraft                       |
| C              | Crowded    | congestion that needs radar sequencing          |
| D              | Dialogue   | Control towers begin; must talk before entering |
| E              | Elsewhere  | Airspace between airways                        |
| G              | Go for it  |                                                 |

## Using Airspaces

### Class G

### Class E

![Air strip that depicts Class E airspace with magenta dotted lines.](../../diagrams/class-e-ktnt.png)

KTNT has a Class E airspace from Surface depicted by the magenta dotted line.

![MOA that depicts Class E airspace with fuzzy blue area.](../../diagrams/class-e-smitty-moa.png)

Within the Cato MOA/Smitty MOA, there is a section of airspace with fuzzy blue box. The fuzzy side of blue is Class E airspace with a floor of 1,200 ft AGL.
