# Airspace

The portion of atmosphere above a country's territory and territorial waters divided into zones by authorities for managing air traffic, safety and military operations with international coordination by ICAO to ensure orderly flight.

## Types of Airspaces

### Controlled

Airspace where air traffic controllers (ATC) actively manage and provide services (i.e. separation) to aircraft.

Classes A, B, C, D and E are controlled airspaces.

### Uncontrolled

The part of airspace where ATC doesn't actively provide separation or direction to aircraft. Pilots here should rely on VFR and self-regulation such as using Common Traffic Advisory Frequencies (CTAFs).

Class G is uncontrolled airspace.

| Airspace Class | Memory Aid | Notes                                           |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A              | Altitude   | > 18,000 MSL ATC tracks                         |
| B              | Big        | big airports and aircraft                       |
| C              | Crowded    | congestion that needs radar sequencing          |
| D              | Dialogue   | Control towers begin; must talk before entering |
| E              | Elsewhere  | Airspace between airways                        |
| G              | Go for it  |                                                 |

## Using Airspaces

Some airspaces are busy and need IFR services to the ground, so class E airspace can go to ground.

### Class G

Class G airspace isn't marked directly in sectionals but is identified by the absense of the other airspaces and height of overlying Class E airspace.

![Air field that depicts Class G airspace with magenta fuzz (below 700 ft AGL) and Class E airspace above.](../../diagrams/class-e-ktnt.png)

### Class E

Class E airspace is shown on a sectional chart with magenta shading (700 ft AGL floor), blue vignettes (1200 ft AGL floor), blue shaded lines (Victor Airways) and dashed magenta lines (surface floor).

![Air strip that depicts Class E airspace with magenta dotted lines.](../../diagrams/class-e-ktnt.png)

KTNT has a Class E airspace from Surface depicted by the magenta dotted line.

![MOA that depicts Class E airspace with fuzzy blue area.](../../diagrams/class-e-smitty-moa.png)

Within the Cato MOA/Smitty MOA, there is a section of airspace with fuzzy blue box. The fuzzy side of blue is Class E airspace with a floor of 1,200 ft AGL.

### Class D

Class D airspace is shown on a sectional chart as a blue dashed circle (segmented line) around an airport.

Delta airspaces are only operational during control tower hours.

> Tower closed: Becomes **Class E** _or_ **Class G if no official reporting weather or comms**.

![Class D airport on a sectional. Van Nuys, LA](../../diagrams/class-d-kvny.png)

It starts from surface and usually goes to 2,500 ft above the airport. A number in a dashed square will show the ceiling of the Delta airspace. The core area is 4.4 nautical miles or (5.5 statue miles). Lateral dimentions are based on instrument procedures established for the airspace.

![San Luis Obispo airport has a higher Class D shelf.](../../diagrams/class-d-ksbp.png)

San Luis Obispo airport has a higher ceiling for its Class D airspace at 2,700 ft MSL.

![Salnias airport has a special ceiling for the Class D airspace.](../../diagrams/class-d-ksns.png)

Salnias airport has a Class D airspace where its celing is not inclusive at 2,500 ft MSL as shown by the dashed square box.

#### Minimum Equipment

> A VHF transmitter and receiver (comms radio) is required for two-way communication.

Prior to flying into this airspace you must have two-way radio communication with the tower (during operation hours).

###### Can enter airspace

> _Tower: 7153 Papa, Stand By_

You can enter the airspace as two-way communication has been established.

###### CANNOT enter airspace

> _Tower: Aircraft calling stand by_

Your tail number must be read back by ATC for two-communication.

> _Tower: Commanche 7153 Papa, stand by and stay clear_

#### Landings & Takeoff

A clearance is required to take off or land at a primary airport in Class D airspace.

If landing at a secondary airport in Class D you must radio the primary **before** entering. As for take off from a secondary, radio primary as soon as possible when able in air.

If ATC is too busy and other factors and there's explicit instructions, stay out of the airspace.

#### IFR Operations

Separation services from other IFR aircraft, along with sequencing, traffic advisories and safety alerts.

#### Tower Services

ATC towers provide the follow services:

1. Keeping airplanes separated on the runway
2. Facilitates safe, orderly and expeditious flow
3. Provies advirsories and separation services
