# Airspace

The portion of atmosphere above a country's territory and territorial waters divided into zones by authorities for managing air traffic, safety and military operations with international coordination by ICAO to ensure orderly flight.

## Types of Airspaces

### Controlled

Airspace where air traffic controllers (ATC) actively manage and provide services (i.e. separation) to aircraft.

Classes A, B, C, D and E are controlled airspaces.

### Uncontrolled

The part of airspace where ATC doesn't actively provide separation or direction to aircraft. Pilots here should rely on VFR and self-regulation such as using Common Traffic Advisory Frequencies (CTAFs).

Class G is uncontrolled airspace.

| Airspace Class | Memory Aid | Notes                                           |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A              | Altitude   | > 18,000 MSL ATC tracks                         |
| B              | Big        | big airports and aircraft                       |
| C              | Crowded    | congestion that needs radar sequencing          |
| D              | Dialogue   | Control towers begin; must talk before entering |
| E              | Elsewhere  | Airspace between airways                        |
| G              | Go for it  |                                                 |
