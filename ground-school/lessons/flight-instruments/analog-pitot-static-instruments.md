# What are the Pitot Static Instruments?

1. Airspeed Indicator
2. Vertical Speed Indicator (Rate of Climb Inidcator)
3. Altimeter

# Altimeter

An instrument that measures an aicraft's altitude or how high it is above sea level.

![Altimeter](../../diagrams/altimeter.png)

The hands tell you the calculated air pressure calibrated in 1000's of feet above sea level.

## Reading

There are three hands which are read individually. Add up the results to get the final reading.

1. Thin hand - 10,000's
2. Tie hand - 1,000's
3. Long hand - 100's

_Each hand indicates the percentage between the two numbers the previous hand is_

# Vertical Speed Indicator

An instrument that measures how quickly an aircraft is ascending or descending.

It measures the speed of air rushing in and out of the pitot static system.

_Other known names: Variometer, Rate of Climb Indicator, Vertical Velocity Indicator_

![Vertical Speed Indicator](../../diagrams/vertical-speed-indicator.png)

Reads air pressure changes at altitude. At high altitudes, air wants to rush out of the tube/hole.

**Airspeed** is calculated from the difference in rammed air and calm of the pressure air tube.

## Clogged Tubes & Vents

### Pitot Tubes

#### How can it happen?

It could be bugs, ice, mud clog from landings.

In cases of icing, turn the heat switch on from the instrument panels.

#### Which instrument is affected?

> Airspeed Indicator

### Static Port

#### Which instrument is affected?

> All instruments (altimeter, vertical speed & airspeed)
