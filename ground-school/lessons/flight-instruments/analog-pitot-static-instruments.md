# What are the Pitot Static Instruments?

1. Airspeed Indicator
2. Vertical Speed Indicator (Rate of Climb Inidcator)
3. Altimeter

# Altimeter

An instrument that measures an aicraft's altitude or how high it is above sea level.

The hand tells you the calculated air pressure calibrated in 1000's of feet above sea level.

# Vertical Speed Indicator

An instrument that measures how quickly an aircraft is ascending or descending.

It measures the speed of air rushing in and out of the pitot static system.

_Other known names: Variometer, Rate of Climb Indicator, Vertical Velocity Indicator_

Reads air pressure changes at altitude. At high altitudes, air wants to rush out of the tube/hole.
