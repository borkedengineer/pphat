# Aircraft instruments

**Glass cockpit**: Aircraft with electronic displays and equipment.

**Analog instrument**: Mechanical devices that provide basic flight information.

- Usually aircraft have these for backup

# Attitude Instrument

Shows the attitude of the aircraft with respect to the horizon.
Often referred to as artificial horizon.

> The direction of the bank is determined by the relationship of the miniature airplane to the horizon bar
>
> - Pitch of the aircaft (nose) is shown by the dot in the horizon

The horizon moves left and right when banking and up and down when pitching.

# Heading Indicator

Shows the heading of the aircraft like a compass.

### Why is it needed?

1. Stays stable -> compass can bounce around
2. No turning errors

**Gyroscope:** Mechanical device that senses rotational motion and detect orientation to determine what direction the aircraft is facing. _(Small spinning wheel.)_

- Azis it spins around wants to stay lined up in the positoin it started ("rigidity in space")

### What do you have to do get accurate inidication from the Heading Indicator?

- Use the knob to periodically align the Heading Indicator with the compass

> Best time to do this would be in _straight and level flight_.

**Gyroscopic Precession**: Drifting from heading due to friction and Earth's rotation.

# Turn Coordinator

An aircraft instrument that displays the rate of a turn and whether the aircraft is slipping or turning during the turn.
