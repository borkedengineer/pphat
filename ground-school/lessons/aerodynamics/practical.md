# Practical Aerodynamics

## Why do you put flaps down on an aircraft?

1. Increase the drag
2. Also increase lift

> Flaps are used to increase the descent angle without lowering airspeed.

## What is aircraft stability?

An aircraft's stability can measured by the three axes it can rotate over.

### Aircraft axes

| **Axes of Rotation** | **Airplane Movement** | **Primary Control Surface** | **Type of Stability** |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Longitudinal         | Roll                  | Aileron                     | Lateral               |
| Lateral              | Pitch                 | Elevator/Stabilator         | Longitudinal          |
| Vertical             | Yaw                   | Rudder                      | Directional           |

### Longitudinal Stability

Recall that the nose is pitching over the lateral axist but moving longitudinally.

Most planes are built so that if you pull the nose up and let go it goes back to equilibrium as it oscillates.

**Longitudinal Stability**: Refers to the aircraft's stability in its plane of symmetry about the lateral axis.

#### What determines Longitudinal Stability?

Location of Centre of Gavity (CG) to Center of Lift determines the longitudinal stability of the aircraft.

Note that CG is usually infront of the center of lift and the tail exerts a downward force.

**Inherently Stable**: The aircraft requires less effort to control.

> Landing to the most aft CG limit is less stable for all speeds.

### Controllability

Controllability is impacted by:

1. Location of CG
2. Power changes
3. Change in AoA (Î±)

> CG that is aft of limits makes it difficult to recover from stalled conditions.

Reducing power with no control adjustments yields less air from propeller slipstream. The nose will pitch up.

Elevator effectiveness is reduced when:

1. Power is reduced
2. Downwash from propeller slipstream is reduced
